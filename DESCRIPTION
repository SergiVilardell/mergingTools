Description: This contains two tools to merge HEMs from different subexperiments. HRM, which uses order statistics to merge; and MUCH which merges using a multivariate normal distribution.

Cazorla, "HRM: Merging Hardware Event Monitors for Improved Timing Analysis of Complex MPSoCs," in IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems, vol. 39, no. 11, pp. 3662-3673, Nov. 2020, <doi:10.1109/TCAD.2020.3013051>.
